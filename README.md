# Contact-Form
First I have created the index.html, style.css and contact.js files. I have written the html code, css styling and and the javascript logic for the form to work efficiently. I have created a client side submission form and included name, email, feedback as the form inputs. I have also shown error messages on invalid inout and success messages on successful form submission.
